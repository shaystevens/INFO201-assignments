# INFO201 Milestone 2
___<h2>Summary Report</h2>___
I had two many to many relationships in my erd diagram that I fixed.
<ol>
<li> Cart may have many products and products may be linked to many carts
<li> Order will have one or many products, or a product may be in many orders
</ol>
I solved these many to many problems by adding Cart_Item and Order_details respectively

So a order must have one or more order details, The order details are linked to one and only one order. Order details must be linked to one and only one product, and a product may have many orders.

A cart may have many cart items, and the cart item must be linked to one cart. A cart item must be linked to one product, and a product may be linked to a cart item
